From my opinion the first actually real pc cleaner coded in .Net and posted on github. Correct me if im wrong of course...

# Features

* Privacy cleaner (Edge Chromium, Google Chrome & Mozilla Firefox).
* Windows Explorer cleaning options.
* Advanced filter options.
* Extra application log & temp cleanup options.
* Windows paths and more included options
* Most paths that Ccleaner target are also included.
* Run at Windows startup, Normal size or minimized.
* Advanced scan options, (Show results, rescan ect...).
* Username and system information stored in propterties to prevent lag but these can be reset in the settings form.
* System tray icon with options.

# Devcomponents

* Donwload the crack from here: https://mega.nz/file/nEMWXJjI#bmLv5HZbfpbi0TPYyuaNwA8p1enjrGBU0DO4c3N6P-o 
* Run the setup file and wait for it to finish installing
* Run the patch setup

# NOTE

* Compile in AnyCpu / Make sure the latest version of .Net Framework is installed. / DevComp is needed aswell as Guna UI.
* Would be nice to improve on the scan feature.... Perhaps I will in the future.
